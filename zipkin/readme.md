# Zipkin

This directory contains the code for the Zipkin service, which is used for distributed tracing in microservices architectures.
For a educational purpose the Zipkin jar is included in the project, but in production you should use the official zipkin server.

Download the latest version of Zipkin from the [official website](https://zipkin.io/).
